= Proven to Engage & Convert = 
Icegram is based on time tested marketing and behavior science principles. Icegram messages have given **phenomenal 60% click through rates** to people and they never fail to deliver. When you use Icegram, you don't need to learn all those marketing secrets.. Icegram does that for you...

= Zero Learning Curve =
Most other plugins are full of complicated screens and options. Icegram was designed to be easy from the ground up. You can manage campaigns and messages from a single screen. And most importantly, you won't have to call a tech friend to understand a thing! 

= Beautiful, Customizable Theme Designs = 
Icegram comes with 20 beautiful themes. They integrate well with your favorite WordPress theme and do not slow down your site. When you want to customize override styling with custom CSS.

= Complete Control Over Message Content & Delivery =
Determine where, when and how to show on-site marketing messages to visitors. Use fine grained targeting rules for niche segmentation. Plus, Icegram gives you the fully powered WordPress editor for your content. You can use any layout and formatting for content within each message container.

* Continue using powerful **short codes your theme provides** for layout and styling
* Add **HD Videos / Audio or any other multimedia** content
* Embed subscription forms from **mailing list service of your choice**
* Use short codes **other plugins** provide – embed forms, widgets, social sharing buttons, twitter feed…
* Add **inline JavaScript or CSS** for customizations
* Target campaigns on different pages - with Wildcard URLs, page selection and more...
* **Full HTML** editing capability for maximum control

= Works with Multi Site, WPML and even non WordPress sites =
Icegram and its addons are WordPress Multisite compatible. Each site becomes an independent Icegram installation.

Icegram is also *WPML Compatible*. You can show multilingual messages in different languages as you wish.

And, as a matter of fact you can show Icegram campaign and messages on non WordPress sites too! Use the premium Icegram Remote addon, and you can show Icegram campaigns anywhere.

= Icegram is a Good Neighbour =
Icegram works with most WordPress plugins and themes. It can integrate with all mailing list / newsletter / optin / CRM / form services that provide embeddable HTML form too. 

Icegram works with MailChimp, Aweber, Constant Contact, MadMimi, Campaign Monitor, Get Response, Klawoo, iContact, e-GOI, SendPress, MailPoet, Infusion Soft, Email Buddy, My Mail and all others..

Similarly, you can embed forms in Icegram messages using shortcodes / HTML from Gravity Forms, Contact Form 7, Ninja Forms, JetPack, Formidable Pro, Inbound Now, Quform, Fast Secure Form, Visual Form Builder and many others...

Icegram campaigns and messages can be shown anywhere in WordPress using shortcodes. And Icegram has a fairly extensive API for creating new message types, themes and addons.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload contents of the plugin to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on 'Icegram' option within WordPress admin sidebar menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Messages look broken / formatting is weird... =

This is most likely due to CSS conflicts with current theme. We suggest using simple formatting for messages. You can also write custom CSS in your theme to fix any problems.

= Extra Line Breaks / Paragraphs in messages... =

Go to HTML mode in content editor and pull your custom HTML code all together in one line. Don't leave blank lines between two tags. That should fix it.

= How do I add custom CSS for messages? =

You can use custom CSS/JS inline in your message HTML. You can also use your theme's custom JS / CSS feature to add your changes.

= Optin Forms / Mailing service integration... =

You can embed any optin / subscription form to your Icegram messages using HTML code. You may even use a shortcode if you are using a WP plugin from your newsletter / lead capture service. 

Use the "Embed Form" button above the text editor to paste in HTML code from your mailing list service and let Icegram automatically "clean it up" for usage in Icegram messages.

= Preview does not work / not refreshing... =

Doing a browser refresh while previewing will not show your most recent changes. Click 'Preview' button to see a preview with your latest changes.

= Can I use shortcodes in a message? =

Yes! Messages support shortcodes. You may need to adjust CSS so the shortcode output looks good in your message.

= I can't find a way to do X... =
